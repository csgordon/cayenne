<h1>Doubtful features</h1>

There are some features of Cayenne that should not be used
normally, but for completeness they are mentioned here.

<h2>Native</h2>
Members of a record can be declared native, the body then
consists of a string that is emitted literally in the generated LML
code.<p>
This feature may disappear.

<h2>Use <samp>*</samp></h2>
In the open clause it is possible to give <samp>*</samp> instead of a
list of identifiers.  This will bring all the members of the record
into scope.  It is a dubious feature since it introduces bound names
without an explicit binding construct.<p>
This feauture may disappear.
