To build and install cayenne do

        gunzip < cayenne-YYYY-MM-DD.tgz | tar xf -
        cd Cayenne
        make
        make install

If you don't want to install in /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/lib/cayenne you can do

	make BINDIR=foo CAYENNEDIR=bar install

In this case you also need to set the environment variable
CAYENNEDIR=bar when running cayenne.


There is some documentation in the html directory.


There's plenty of bugs, so tread carefully. :)
